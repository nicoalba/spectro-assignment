# Technical Writer Assignment

This assignment will test your writing abilities. The hiring manager will review the deliverable before the technical interview. During the technical interview, you will have the opportunity to discuss your changes.

The assignment is not passed or failed but instead used as an indicator to help us understand your capabilities.

Please submit the assignment no later than 24 hours before the technical interview.

## Instructions

Create a personal repository containing all your changes in a new branch. You may clone this repository if you would like, but please don't fork and submit a pull request (PR) to this repository. If you need guidance in cloning a repository, check out the [Clone a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide from GitHub.

The file in this folder, [assignment](assignment.md), contains text that is intended to go to a documentation reference page. Your task is to improve the text and help improve the reading experience. You have the freedom to change everything you feel is needed. This includes adding or removing content and changing the markdown elements such as headings, links, titles, images, and code snippets. Make the changes you feel improve the quality of the text and the learning experience. We ask that all changes comply with the [style guide](/style_guide.md) provided.

Create a pull request (PR) in your repository when you have completed all the changes and are satisfied with the results. Email a link to the PR to the person you have been in contact with throughout the hiring process. Ensure the repository has public access so the hiring manager can review the PR.

## Assumptions
- The reader has basic knowledge of Kubernetes. The user is not an expert but has some experience with Kubernetes.
- The current text is a draft. You are a technical writer tasked with improving the text and content.
- You can use Gitlab, GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other versioning control system to host your deliverable.
- Assume the content would reside in a formal documentation site.
- Users of all skill level will read the content.
- This is not a [tutorial](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/public-cloud/deploy-k8s-cluster), nor a [procedural document](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/cluster-management/remove-clusters) (Step 1 ... Step N). The content is intended to be a reference page for beginners and experts to find information about a topic. The content should provide enough information to help the reader understand the concept and how to use the various commands.

## Tips

- Create a new git branch before making any changes.

- Carefully review the [style guide](../style_guide.md).

- Use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and its features.

- Research the topic if you have no prior experience with Kubernetes. Ask yourself how you could present the information that would benefit both a beginner and an expert.

- Ask yourself how the reference page you are editing can provide value in addition to the resource links provided in the text. *Hint* - replicating the offical Kubernetes documentation is not the answer.

- Review grammar and language. Writing content littered with typos and awkward language results in a poor reader experience.

- Have someone review your writing to help you catch ambiguities and parts of the writing that may be confusing to read.

- Review your final changes with fresh eyes after some time has passed to catch language, flow, and typos.
